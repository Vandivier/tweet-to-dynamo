# tweet-to-dynamo
Serverless Node app that saves tweets to Dynamo

# Setup

Just remember. Serverless is cost-efficient, not simple.

1. Create an AWS account.
2. Create an S3 bucket

    a. I called mine `s3-tweet-to-dynamo`. It's [accessible here](http://s3-tweet-to-dynamo.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/) if you want to interact with a running instance of the app.

    b. Create with all default permissions.
    
    c. After creating it, go to its properties and turn on [static website hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html).

    d. Now go to permissions and enable `Public access` to the `Everyone` group for the `List objects` feature.
3. Download and install [S3 Browser](http://s3browser.com/).
4. Add the S3 account to S3 Browser.

    a. S3 Browser has instructions for this.

    b. You will need to create an IAM user. Just give it programmatic access permission. I called mine `app-s3-tweet-to-dynamo`. Give that user the permission `AmazonS3FullAccess`.

5. Drag the content of the S3 folder from the repo and drop in the right pane of the S3 Browser GUI for the new S3 account you just added. Then visit the bucket's public URL to see the home page!
